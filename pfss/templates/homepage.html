                <p>
                The Pathfinder Summoner's Scribe (PFSS) can be used to generate on-screen displays or print-outs
                of summonable creatures from the Pathfinder Role-playing game.</p>
                <p>
                Creatures may be displayed individually, in groups of your choosing, or
                in pre-populated groups representing useful sets of creatures such as
                those available through Summon Monster 1, for example<p>
                <p>
                The PFSS will dynamically apply the effects of the Augment Summons
                feat to any creatures that you wish. Automatically modifying stats such
                as attacks, skills and even special effect DCs based on this feat. You may
                apply the feat to some, all, or none of the creatures in a particular list.</p>

                <p>An exciting new alternative to the One Book Shelf monopoly in the RPG market. Buy OSR, 5e and other RPG systems from a company that gives creators a larger share of the purchase price. Backed by many of the big names in OSR and 3rd party RPG publishing (Frog God Games, Kobold Press, Troll Lord Games and many more).  </p>
